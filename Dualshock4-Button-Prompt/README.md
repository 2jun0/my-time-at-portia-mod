# Dualshock4-Button-Prompt

This mod is an port version of [Dualshock 4 Button prompts](https://www.nexusmods.com/mytimeatportia/mods/35)

For those that prefer the Dualshock 4 icons over the xbox ones, or simply can't get the dualshock 4 icons to appear natively via steam.
This mod will force the game to use the dualshock 4 icons by replacing the textures directly.

Install this mod by doing the following:

1. Navigate to your game installation folder.\
E.G: 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\My Time At Portia' or '[YourGameFolder]'

2. Find the AssetBundles folder located in 'Portia_Data\StreamingAssets\AssetBundles'

3. Extract the file from the zip, then copy and paste the downloaded file 'uisystem' into this folder and overwrite.

4. You should now see Dualshock 4 icons ingame.
